Man, just walked outta that Raid 2 screening, and my brain’s all scrambled, like those eggs I make for breakfast that always end up too salty. Theater was buzzing – so much noise, people chompin’ on popcorn like it’s their last meal on earth. Some kid kept kickin’ the back of my seat, like he was channeling Rama’s fierce spirit or somethin’. But damn, what a ride. Pure chaos, limbs flyin' like when that storm took down my barn roof last summer.

Honestly, the first scenes just blur in my head – like tryin’ to remember a dream after waking up. Car chase? Or was it a fistfight first? Doesn’t matter – both were like a barn fire outta control, flames licking up everything. I kept thinkin', who choreographs these? Madmen with wild imaginations, that's who. Almost spilled my soda when that guy took a hit so hard I swear he flew across the room like a scarecrow caught in a whirlwind.

> Was it snowing in one of the scenes? Or was that popcorn someone tossed? Either way, the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was drenched in blood, like a B-grade horror flick meets martial arts drama. Beyond bonkers, but like a good kind. Everybody takin’ hits, and it all felt so... real. My back aches from sittin’ too long, but worth every second, like digging a trench in stony ground only to strike water unexpectedly.

Now, what was I saying? Right, the prison scene! Mud, fistfights, madness – makes every family reunion seem like a tea party. People 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   won’t get the full impact without the surround sound, trust me. You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a theater to feel the punches in your bones, like a tractor rumbling over uneven ground.

And then, y’know, there’s that moment where you just sit there, 'n think, how did this all fit into one  ? It’s like tryin’ to squeeze a whole haystack into one bale. But they did it, somehow. It’s all visceral and violent, yet poetic, like... like a Shakespeare play performed by frenzied chickens.

Told you I’d write after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨, didn’t expect it’d be like this. Just remember, it’s worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, even for us simple folk who live for clear skies and quiet nights. Guess it’s time to wind down.
